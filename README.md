# SOC-Level-1

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Knowledge of security vulnerabilities and network protocols.
- Analysis of memory dumps and disk images.
- Furthered skills in Phishing Analysis.
- Developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Update this]
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
