# SOC-Level-1

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Knowledge of security vulnerabilities and network protocols.
- Analysis of memory dumps and disk images.
- Furthered skills in Phishing Analysis.
- Developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems (Splunk & Elastic) for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (Wireshark, BRIM, Zeek) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Endpoint Security Monitoring logs (Sysmon, Windows Event Logs/Viewer) for analysis of devices.
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (Autopsy, TheHive, Volatility) to look at memory dumps & device images.
- Phishing Analysis was performed (Thunderbird) to determine the techniques used by attackers.
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (MITRE ATT&CK, VirusTotal, CyberChef) to gain insight to Tactics & Techniques used by attackers.
